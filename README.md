# SQL Data Cleaning - Layoffs 2022

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning using SQL, applied to the **Layoffs 2022 dataset** from Kaggle. The dataset contains information on layoffs across various industries worldwide. The goal is to clean and prepare the data for further analysis using SQL best practices.

## 🗂 Dataset Source
- The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Layoffs 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)

## 🛠 Data Cleaning Steps
The SQL script performs the following data cleaning operations:
1. **Creating a Staging Table** - Preserving raw data for reference.
2. **Removing Duplicates** - Identifying and eliminating duplicate entries.
3. **Standardizing Data** - Correcting formatting issues and inconsistencies.
4. **Handling Null Values** - Reviewing missing data and applying appropriate handling techniques.
5. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns** - Removing columns that do not add value to the analysis.

## 📂 Project Files
- `Data Cleaning Project.sql` - Contains the SQL script for cleaning the dataset.

## 🏁 How to Use
To run this project:
1. Load the dataset into a SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any compatible system).
2. Execute `Data Cleaning Project.sql` step by step.
3. Review the cleaned dataset in the staging table.
